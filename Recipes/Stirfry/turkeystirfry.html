        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup low-sodium soy sauce</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
            
        </ul>

        <h3>Ground Turkey and Veggies</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 cups sliced baby bella mushrooms</li>
            <li>1/2 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 green bell pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 small onion, peeled and sliced vertically</li>
            <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
            <li>2 gloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>sliced green onions and toasted sesame seeds for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <li>Whisk soy sauce, rice vinegar, lime juice, brown sugar, sesame oil, and cornstarch together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the mushrooms, red and green bell peppers, and onion, and cook just until vegetables are tender, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove to a plate.</li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <li>Add the remaining tablespoon oil to the skillet. Add ground turkey and cook,breaking up the meat into chunks with a spatula, until lightly browned and cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low, return vegetables to the skillet, give sauce a good stir, and pour over meat and veggies. Stir until everything is well coated, and simmer until the sauce is thickened slightly, about 2 minutes.</li>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <li>Taste, and adjust seasoning. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds, and serve immediately</li>
        </ol>

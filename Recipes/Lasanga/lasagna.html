            <li>1/2 teaspoon of dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 box of lasagna sheets</li>
            <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
            <li>1 package shredded Mozzarella Cheese</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <li>
                Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <li>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic,
            basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna sheets in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degree F(190 degrees C).</li>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
                <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9X13-inch baking dish just to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
                <h4>Step 7</h4>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
                <h4>Step 8</h4>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let it stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
